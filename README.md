# [Self Care Center](https://aburg15.github.io/self-care-center/)
Self Care Center is an application that allows users to view a random affirmation or mantra message. Either an affirmation or mantra message will be displayed, depending on the message option selected.

## How to Use the App:

- Go to [Self Care Center](https://aburg15.github.io/self-care-center/)

- The user is presented with the option to display either an affirmation or mantra message.  Once the user selects their preferred option, they can select "Receive Message" to view the message.

- Once a message option has been selected and the user selects "Receive Message", the meditation image is replaced with a random message, which is either an affirmation or mantra, depending on the users selection.

- After a message has been generated and is displayed, the user can select "Clear" to replace the current message with the meditation image.  The meditation image will remain in place until a new message is selected.
